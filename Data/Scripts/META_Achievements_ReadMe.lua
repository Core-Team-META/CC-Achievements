       Description:

    With a lot of customization options, creators have full control on how, when and why players can unlock Achievements. 
    
    
    Setup
    =====

    1. To begin add the Achievement System to your heirarchy.
    2. Select the Achievement System folder to view it's custom properties. Each custom property impacts how the system will work
    in your game. For more information on each option, hover over the custom property name to reveal the tooltip explaining each setting.


    Adding / Editing Achievements
    =============================

    1. Expand the Achievement System to view it's children and expand the AchievementList:
        1) As children of the AchievementList you'll see several groups. As an example expand the "KILL" group to see the "Kill Example"
        object. 
        2) This is an example Achievement, click on it to reveal the different options as custom properties, which all impact how
        the Achievement will function in your game.
        3) Hover over any of the custom properties to reveal the tooltip to see what each option does.

    Note: If an Achievement will grant rewards on completion, be sure that the GivesReward custom property is set to true, and that reward
    data templates are added as children, under the Achievement. Out of the box, the Achievement system allows 1 - 3 different resource based
    rewards.
